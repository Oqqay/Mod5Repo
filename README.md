# Project Delta-Stepping

The purpose of this project is to develop a Shortest-Path-Problem algorithm that utilizes parallelism: completing multiple tasks at the same time. In particular, we intend to apply and implement the research of U. Meyers and P. Sanders, the ones who originally proposed delta-stepping.
